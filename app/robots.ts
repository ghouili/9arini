/* AI assistant crawlers — EXPLICITLY WELCOMED (founder decision 2026-07-12). A
   marketplace that wants to be *recommended* by ChatGPT / Claude / Perplexity / AI
   Overviews should be citable by them. Everything on the public site is truthful —
   no fabricated ratings, stats or testimonials (ratings render only from real
   reviews) — so there is no fabricated-data liability in being quoted. `userAgent:
   "*"` already allows them, but listing them makes the intent explicit and survives
   a future tightening of the wildcard. They still stay out of the private areas. */
