/* CANCEL A CLASS FOR EVERYONE WHO BOOKED IT — the one implementation.

   Used when the TUTOR calls a class off (POST /classes/:id/cancel) and when an
   ADMIN blocks the tutor's account with "cancel upcoming classes"
   (routes/admin-accounts.ts). Both mean the same thing to a student — the class
   will not happen and they owe nothing — so both must move the same rows the same
   way.

   100% RELEASE, ALWAYS. Retaining a share of a seat the student still wanted
   would be charging them for someone else's decision. The ledger records this as
   `waived` rather than pretending the cancellation was early — see the note on
   that flag in @tnajem/shared/cancellation.ts.

   The class status, every booking, the seat count and the ledger rows move in
   ONE transaction. A half-cancelled class — status flipped, students still
   holding seats — is worse than not cancelling at all: they would turn up. */
