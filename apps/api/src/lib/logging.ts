/* Structured logging config.

   THE RULE: a session token, an OTP (hashed or not), a document path, an e-mail
   address and a phone number must never reach a log line.

   This is not hygiene, it is the same rule the product enforces everywhere else.
   /api/cron/purge already keeps document ids out of its HTTP response and only in
   the server log; the storage path is the one string that says which national ID
   scan belongs to whom. And once Step 8 closes contact exchange, an e-mail in a
   request log is the same leak as an e-mail in a JSON response — DevTools is just
   replaced by whoever can read the logs.

   Fastify's redaction runs on the serialised object, so it covers anything we
   attach to the request/reply, plus the headers it logs by default. Paths are
   listed rather than guessed, so adding a field that carries PII means adding it
   here too. */
