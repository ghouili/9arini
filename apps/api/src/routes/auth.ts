/* auth-write. Ported from apps/web/app/actions.ts, branch for branch.

   ── WHY THE SESSION TOKEN COMES BACK IN THE BODY ────────────────────────────
   These endpoints mint a session, and the cookie has to end up on the BROWSER,
   not on the web server that proxied the call. Two options existed: pass
   Set-Cookie through the proxy, or return the token and let the web set it.

   The body wins for now. It keeps the cookie attributes in exactly ONE place
   (apps/web/lib/auth.ts::createSession) rather than requiring a Set-Cookie parser
   that must faithfully round-trip httpOnly/sameSite/secure/expires/path — a
   mismatch on any of those produces two cookies and an intermittently
   logged-out user. The token crosses the web→api hop in a body, which is the
   same trust boundary the cookie itself crosses, so it is no new exposure —
   PROVIDED that body is never logged. lib/logging.ts redacts `token`.

   At Step 5, when the browser talks to api.tnajem.tn directly, the API will set
   cookies itself and Set-Cookie pass-through becomes the natural design.

   ROLE_HINT_COOKIE stays 100% on the web side. It is a forgeable UI hint that
   only decides which nav link renders; the API must not know it exists. */
