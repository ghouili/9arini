   THE SEAT CLAIM IS TRANSCRIBED STATEMENT FOR STATEMENT. DO NOT "CLEAN IT UP".
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Any rewrite of the claim is where overselling comes back. It is guarded by
   e2e/seat-claim.race.spec.ts (16 genuinely concurrent claims on the last seat)
   and by the product-level invariant in e2e/student.spec.ts.

   recomputeTutorStats already moved to apps/api/src/lib/stats.ts in the classes
   domain, precisely so it could join THIS transaction. If it had stayed on the web
   side, the seat claim and the stats update would no longer share a transaction —
   and the lost-update race would return, reintroduced by the refactor. */
