/* Phase A+ · P3 (D13) — the admin audit log is tamper-proof, and required.

   1. admin_actions was append-only "by convention": the app role could UPDATE or
      DELETE any row. 0031 refuses both (and TRUNCATE) in the database. The only
      UPDATE allowed is the FK's own ON DELETE SET NULL when an admin's profile is
      deleted — the row stays, the actor becomes unknown.
   2. auditAdmin swallowed a failed write, so an approval could land with no record.
      Now the row is written in the action's transaction: if it fails, the action
      fails and nothing changes.

   This file leaves its audit rows in place — it cannot delete them, which is the
   point. */
