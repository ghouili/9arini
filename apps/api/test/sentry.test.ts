/* WHAT AN ERROR REPORT MAY CONTAIN (production readiness Stage 7).
 *
 * test/log-pii.test.ts does this job for log lines: it captures every line the API
 * writes and asserts none of them holds an e-mail address or a phone number. Error
 * reports are a SECOND way out of the process, added in Stage 7, and they carry
 * more than a log line does — a stack, local context, the error's own message. So
 * they need the same guard, and it has to be a test rather than a habit: the whole
 * point of the reporter is that it is used on the day everyone is too busy to
 * review what it sends.
 *
 * The first test is the one that will actually catch a regression: it proves the
 * two policies cannot drift, so adding a PII field to the log redaction and
 * forgetting the scrubber fails here instead of shipping.
