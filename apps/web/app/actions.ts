   This is the ONLY place in the codebase that writes `profiles.role = 'tutor'`

   the ROLE GATE comment there for why that was the whole problem.

   Three things it insists on, in order:

     1. AN EXPLICIT CONFIRMATION. `confirm` is not ceremony — it is the difference
        between a role change the user asked for and one that happened to them. The
        /onboarding/upgrade screen is what sets it.

     2. THE CURRENT ROLE IS `student`. A tutor calling this is a no-op success
        (idempotent, so a double-submit or a stale tab cannot fail); anything else
        is refused rather than coerced.

     3. THE USER IS AN ADULT. A tutor is ID-verified and then teaches children, so a
        minor must never hold the role. Age is only ever known for students (we
        collect a birth year at student signup and nowhere else), and it fails safe:
        an unknown age is NOT waved through — the caller is asked for it and it is
        persisted here. isMinorBirthYear treats null as minor, so the refusal below
        catches both "too young" and "still unknown after we asked".

   Role changes must also refresh ROLE_HINT_COOKIE or <SiteHeader> renders the old
   role for the rest of the session's 30 days — hence setRoleHint(). */
