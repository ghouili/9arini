/* THE PUBLIC HEALTH SURFACE — what an uptime monitor watches.
 *
 * It did not exist. PRODUCTION_READINESS.md's Stage 6 gate
 * (`curl -sf https://tnajem.tn/api/health | jq -e '.ok'`) and Stage 7's "uptime
 * monitoring on / and /api/health" both named this URL, and nothing served it:
 * the only health endpoint was the API's, on loopback port 4000, which nginx
 * deliberately does not expose. So the documented check was a 404 and the
 * documented monitor had nothing to poll.
 *
 * WHY THE STATUS CODE IS THE SIGNAL HERE, and a bare 200 with a body is the signal
 * on the API. They are read by different things:
 *   - the API's /health answers Docker's HEALTHCHECK and an operator with curl. It
 *     stays 200 with `db:false` so a failure can SAY WHY (a 503 with an empty body
 *     tells an operator strictly less), and so a storage problem does not pull the
 *     whole API out of rotation.
 *   - this route answers an uptime monitor, and monitors alert on status codes.
 *     Anything degraded is 503, because a monitor that only reads 200 would stay
 *     green through a total database outage.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY NOT LEAK. It is unauthenticated and world-reachable, so it reports
 * booleans and a version, never a reason: a connection error carries the database
 * host, port and user, and "which dependency is down" is enough for the person on
 * call, who then reads the log. The API's own /health applies the same rule.
