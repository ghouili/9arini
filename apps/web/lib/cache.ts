/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   Cache layer for the PUBLIC, ANONYMOUS surface only.

   ── THE ONE RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   NOTHING derived from the session cookie may pass through this file. Ever.
   unstable_cache() has no notion of "who asked" — a value cached during Amine's
   request is served verbatim to Sarra. Everything here takes a slug and returns
   data that is, by definition, identical for every visitor on Earth. If you find
   yourself wanting to cache getDashboard(), getStudentDashboard(),
   getNotifications() or anything that calls getSession(), stop: that is how a
   marketplace shows one student another student's phone number.

   (Mechanically, Next also throws if you call cookies() inside unstable_cache —
   but do not rely on the framework to enforce your privacy model.)

   ── WHY IT EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   A tutor pastes tnajem.tn/<slug> into a WhatsApp group. Thousands of phones
   open the same URL within minutes. Uncached, each one costs 3 sequential round
   trips to Postgres (tutor → classes → packs) plus a 4th for reviews, and a full
   React render. Cached, the whole storm collapses to ONE database read per slug
   per TTL window; the rest is served from memory/disk.
   ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/* ── TTLs ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   STOREFRONT_TTL is the honest trade-off in this codebase.

   The page must not keep serving a tutor we have just REJECTED (getStorefront()
   returns null for anything that is not `verified`, and the page 404s) — a
   rejected tutor's storefront staying public is a trust/compliance problem, not
   a performance one. So the TTL is the WORST-CASE delay between an admin
   clicking "reject" and that page going dark.

   60 seconds is the number:
     • Long enough that a viral spike (which is measured in requests per second,
       not per minute) is absorbed almost entirely by the cache — at 500 req/s
       one slug costs Postgres 1 query per minute instead of 30,000.
     • Short enough that a rejection is live in under a minute, which is well
       inside any reasonable moderation SLA and far faster than the hours it
       takes for a shared link to make its next hop.
     • And it is a CEILING, not a floor: approveTutor/rejectTutor should call
       revalidateTutor(slug) (below) to make the change effective IMMEDIATELY.
       The TTL is what protects us on the day someone edits `tutors.status` by
       hand in psql and forgets the app exists.

   Do NOT push this to an hour to "save queries". Sixty seconds already removes
   ~99.9% of the load; the remaining 0.1% is not worth a rejected tutor being
   public for another 59 minutes. */

/* The sitemap is read by crawlers, not humans. It is a whole-table scan of every
   verified tutor and must never run per request. An hour of staleness costs a

   tutor's own WhatsApp link works instantly regardless. */
