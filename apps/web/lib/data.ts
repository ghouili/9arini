   Server-side reads.

   Two modes, and only two, when there is no API_URL:

     • DEMO MODE (dev + TNAJEM_DEMO=1) → demo fixtures (lib/demo.ts), with a
       banner on every page saying so.
     • ANYTHING ELSE                   → a hard error. NOT fixtures.

   The second rule is the important one. `backendReady` is false whenever API_URL
   is missing — including on a misconfigured deploy or after a rotated secret. The
   old code returned `demoStorefront` in that case *for any slug*, so a production
   boot without a DB would have served a fabricated "4.9★, 1,240 students,
   verified" tutor at every URL of the public site. Fabricating a verified tutor
   and their rating is a misrepresentation; a 500 is just an outage. We take the
   outage.

   Why throw instead of returning null: null makes app/[slug]/page.tsx call
   notFound(), and a site-wide 404 storm tells Google to deindex every real tutor
   page. A 5xx is the honest signal — "we are broken, come back" — and it is the
   one that gets us paged.
