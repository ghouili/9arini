/* Every page under app/[locale], as a pattern — so middleware can tell a real route
   from a 404 BEFORE anything renders.

   Why middleware needs it: /fr/a/b used to reach Next's built-in English "404 —
   This page could not be found" (no locale, no header, no way onward), and
   /fr/class or /fr/live — reserved names with no page of their own — fell into
   app/[locale]/[slug] and rendered the storefront's not-found screen with a 200.
   Middleware now rewrites anything that is not in this table to the localized
   catch-all (app/[locale]/[...rest]) with a 404 status.

   KEPT IN SYNC BY A TEST: e2e/route-table.spec.ts walks app/[locale] and fails if
   a page.tsx exists that is not listed here, or the other way round. `[slug]` and
   `[...rest]` are not listed: middleware handles them itself. Edge-safe. */
