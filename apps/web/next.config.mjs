/* ── Content-Security-Policy ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Why 'unsafe-inline' rather than a nonce, deliberately:

   Next's App Router streams the RSC flight payload and hydration bootstrap as
   INLINE <script>/<style> on every page. The robust alternative — a per-request
   nonce injected by middleware — strips 'unsafe-inline' but forces EVERY response
   to be dynamically rendered (the nonce differs per request), which would defeat
   the ISR/static caching of the storefront that the whole scaling plan rests on
   (SCALABILITY.md: cache the viral page's HTML perfectly). For this app, allowing
   inline while keeping the page cacheable is the right trade — and the highest-risk
   surface (the ID-scan viewer, app/api/admin/doc) already ships its own
   `default-src 'none'; sandbox` CSP, which combines with this one, never loosens it.

   Live video runs on meet.jit.si in a NEW TAB (window.open in app/live), not an
   iframe, so no frame-src/camera/microphone grant is needed on our origin. That
   keeps the policy tight: nothing may frame us, we frame nothing, no plugins,
   no base-tag or form-action hijack, and connect/img/font are self-only. */
