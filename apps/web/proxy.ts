/* Three jobs, in order:

   1. LOCALE ROUTING. Every page lives under /fr/… or /ar/… (app/[locale]/…). A
      request with no locale prefix is redirected to the preferred locale (the
      NEXT_LOCALE cookie set by the language toggle, else French). This is what puts
      the locale in the URL — visible to crawlers, and knowable server-side so the
      public pages can stay statically/ISR-rendered per locale.

   2. AUTH GUARD (presence only). Redirects to /<locale>/auth when the session cookie
      is absent on a protected route. Real validation happens server-side via
      getSession(); the proxy only checks presence and never touches Postgres.

   3. EVERY 404 IS DECIDED HERE, with the status set before anything renders:
        • a path that is no page (lib/route-table.ts)          → catch-all 404
        • one segment that cannot be a slug, or a reserved name
          with no page of its own (/fr/class, /fr/live)          → catch-all 404
        • a well-formed slug no tutor has (lib/tutor-lookup.ts) → catch-all 404
      "Catch-all 404" is a rewrite to app/[locale]/[...rest] with status 404: a
      localized, server-rendered page that is never cached. A runtime notFound()
      could not do this job on Next 14.2 (it shipped an empty body); the decision
      stays here on Next 16, where it is already made before rendering starts. */

     the first byte of HTML — 0.5-1s on Tunisian 3G — on the single most common

     with no extra hop.

     Deeper paths still REDIRECT, deliberately: "/explore" and "/fr/explore"

     signals and duplicates the crawl. The canonical form is the prefixed one,

       the cookie's locale with "Vary: Cookie" — harmless while every page was
       no-store, but once /fr became static a shared cache (a CDN honouring
       s-maxage) could store one visitor's language and serve it to the next.
