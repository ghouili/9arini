#  Runs ON THE VPS, called by .github/workflows/deploy.yml over SSH once it has

#
#      cd /var/www/tnajem && bash deploy.sh

#  Order matters. Install and BUILD first, while nothing is touched: a failed
#  build aborts here (set -e) and the running processes keep serving the previous
#  release. Only then migrate, check the configuration, and restart.
#
#  Two processes, separately supervised — see ecosystem.config.cjs:
#      tnajem-api   Fastify, loopback :4000
#      tnajem-web   Next.js standalone, :3000
