/* The REAL login flow, end to end, through the browser.

   Every other spec mints a session row directly, which is right — they are about
   booking and moderation, not about login. But that means nothing exercised
   requestOtp/verifyOtp, so when they were ported to apps/api the whole suite
   would have stayed green even if the port were completely broken.

   This spec is the one that would catch it. It also exercises the single most
   fragile agreement in the split: apps/web and apps/api must hash an OTP
   identically, or a code minted by one cannot be verified by the other and login
   fails intermittently depending on which process served the request.
   support/otp.ts recovers the plaintext by brute force from otp_codes.code_hash
   (10^6 space, ~1s) using AUTH_SECRET — no production code change, and it fails
   loudly if the hash construction ever drifts. */

     that looks exactly like an application bug. */

     The submit button is `disabled={loading}` and is REUSED across both steps of

     to become "visible, enabled and stable" again, burning the whole test timeout.
     That is what made this the only flaky spec in the suite — reliably ~3s alone,
     intermittently 2 minutes in a full run.

     requestSubmit() fires the real submit path (validation included) directly on
     the form, so there is no element to be actionable. Same trade as the

  /* WAIT FOR THE NAVIGATION BEFORE READING THE COOKIE JAR.

     The three polls above are all SERVER-side signals — rows in Postgres. The
     assertion below is a BROWSER-side one, and the two are not simultaneous: the
     session row exists the moment verifyOtp commits, while the Set-Cookie is
     still travelling back to Chromium. Reading the jar straight after the row
     appeared is therefore a race the product never promised to win, and it lost
     it once in four full runs against containers, where the extra hop widens the
     window. On a green run this wait returns immediately.

     SignupInner calls router.push(postAuthDestination(...)) once verifyOtp
     resolves, so leaving /signup/eleve is the real readiness signal — and it
     necessarily happens AFTER the response that carried the cookie.

     Deliberately "any path but this one", not the specific destination:
     postAuthDestination is a five-rung priority list and pinning the exact
     landing page here would couple this spec to logic it is not testing.
