/* CANCELLATION — 48h free, 40% retained, and the ledger that records it.

   apps/api/test/cancellation.test.ts pins the arithmetic. This pins the two
   things only a real request can show: that the endpoint APPLIES it, and that
   the ledger row is actually written — in the same transaction as the seat
   release, so a crash between them cannot leave the two disagreeing.

   THE HEADLINE IS A LOOSENING. The old rule refused inside 24h ("too-late"), so
   the seat stayed locked to someone who was not coming and the tutor could not
   resell it. A late cancellation now succeeds.

   ADDED, never edited into an existing spec — the Stage A rule still holds. */
