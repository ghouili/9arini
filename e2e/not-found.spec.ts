/* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   An unknown tutor slug is a REAL 404 — with a page a person can read.

   The distribution model is a tutor pasting tnajem.tn/<their-name> into
   WhatsApp. On 14 Sept a nonsense slug answered 200 with another tutor's full
   storefront and a working "Réserver". Two things are pinned here, and neither
   is allowed to buy the other:

     1. The STATUS is 404 (middleware.ts sets it — a runtime notFound() on
        Next 14.2 would ship an empty <body>, see app/[locale]/[slug]/page.tsx).
     2. The BODY is in the server HTML: the check runs with JavaScript OFF.

   And the rule the middleware depends on: every top-level route is a reserved
   slug. A route missing from RESERVED_SLUGS would be looked up as a tutor, not
   found, and answer 404 to every visitor.

   ADDED, never edited into an existing spec. */
