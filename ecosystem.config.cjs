/* pm2 process file — the two Tnajem processes, supervised separately.
 *
 * Since the backend split there is no single process to run: the Next.js front end
 * and the Fastify API are separate, hold different secrets (the web tier has no
 * DATABASE_URL at all) and fail independently. One pm2 app each, started by
 * deploy.sh:
 *
 *     pm2 start  ./ecosystem.config.cjs --only tnajem-api --env production
 *     pm2 reload ./ecosystem.config.cjs --only tnajem-web --env production
 *     pm2 logs tnajem-web        pm2 status        pm2 save
 *
 * .cjs, not .js: this file must be CommonJS (`module.exports`) whatever the root
 * package.json says, and the root has no "type" field today — a later
 * `"type": "module"` there would otherwise turn every pm2 command into a
 * "module is not defined" crash at deploy time. Paths come from __dirname for the
 * same class of reason: `pm2 start ./ecosystem.config.cjs` must behave identically
 * from the repo root, from a systemd unit, and from a non-login SSH shell.
 *
 * NO SECRETS HERE. Both processes read the repo-root .env themselves (apps/api via
 * src/env.ts, the web runner via scripts/serve-standalone.mjs), and that file is
 * written by .github/workflows/deploy.yml from the "deploy" GitHub Environment.
 * A real environment variable always wins over the file, which is what env_production
 * below relies on.
