/* @tnajem/db — the schema, the connection factory, and the document store.

   This package OWNS the drizzle-orm dependency. Everything that builds a query
   imports the operators from here rather than from "drizzle-orm" directly, so
   there is exactly one place the ORM version is pinned and exactly one boundary
   to move when apps/api takes over the queries in Step 4.

   Gate 2 asserts that: `grep -rn "drizzle-orm" apps/web/app apps/web/components`
   must be 0. */
