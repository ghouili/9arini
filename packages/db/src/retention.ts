/* ID-document retention purge (INPDP / Loi 2004-63 · Tunisia).
 *
 * /privacy publicly promises: identity documents are deleted AT MOST 90 days
 * after the verification decision. This module is what makes that true.
 *
 * What it does, for every tutor whose verification was DECIDED (status
 * "verified" or "rejected") more than RETENTION_DAYS ago:
 *   1. removes the file from the object store (STORAGE_DRIVER, local by default), then
 *   2. removes the matching `verification_docs` row.
 * File first, row second — if the unlink fails we keep the row so the next run
 * retries it (a row without a file is a lie; a file without a row is a leak).
 *
 * The row is replaced by a verification_traces row (0021) in the same
 * transaction: kind, upload date, decision, decision date — what /privacy says
 * is kept, and nothing else.
 *
 * Tutors in "draft" or "pending" are NEVER touched: the admin queue still needs
 * their documents. Tutors with a NULL reviewed_at are skipped too (no decision
 * date = no retention clock).
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running finds nothing left to do; a missing file is not an
 * error (counted as `filesMissing`) and its row is still purged.
 *
 * NOTE: this module deliberately does NOT import "@/lib/db" — that module is
 * guarded by `server-only` and throws under `tsx`. Callers pass their own
 * drizzle handle, so the same code runs from the CLI script and from the
 * cron route. Same reason lib/db/seed.ts connects directly.

   Expired auth rows (SCALABILITY.md §5 / §7).

   `sessions` grows by one row per LOGIN (30-day expiry) and `otp_codes` by one row
   per OTP REQUEST (5-minute expiry). Nothing ever deleted an expired row from
   either: createOtp only clears the rows for the ONE phone it is minting a code
   for, and createSession only GCs the expired rows of the ONE profile logging in.
   So both tables grow exactly as fast as the product does, forever — and every
   login then reads through that garbage.

   Deleting an expired row can never log anyone out or invalidate a code that would
   still have worked: getSession() already treats `expires_at < now()` as no session
   (and deletes it), and verifyOtpCode() already treats it as no code. This purge is
   pure housekeeping — it removes rows the auth layer considers dead already.

   Indexed: `sessions_expires_at_idx` / `otp_codes_expires_at_idx` (schema.ts) make
   both statements index scans rather than a seq scan of a forever-growing table.

   Idempotent, overlap-safe, and unconditional on tutor status — nothing here is
   subject to the 90-day ID-document window; the expiry timestamp on the row IS the
   retention policy. Same contract as purgeExpiredVerificationDocs: the caller
   passes the db handle (so this runs under `tsx` as well as inside Next), dry-run
   only counts, and the return value is the audit record.
