   The policy: a free first session is OPT-IN, per tutor, and OFF by default.
   Before this existed the platform promised one on behalf of every tutor who
   never touched a checkbox, on ~30 screens, in the JSON-LD Offer, in the meta
   description and in llms.txt — a claim about money that no tutor made.

   The rule is an AND of two columns, and it lives here rather than being written
   out at each call site for the reason this project has now hit three separate
   times: two implementations of one rule that nothing forces to agree. A
   storefront that ANDs and a booking endpoint that does not is the difference
   between a page that says "free" and a charge that isn't. */

    `tutorOptsIn` is the master switch — a policy the tutor set once.
    `classIsFree` is the per-listing detail, so a tutor who opts in can still run
    a paid intensive.

    Deliberately takes `boolean | null | undefined` on both sides: rows written
    before 0008 could be null, and a null must read as NO. Anything else would
    make "never set" mean "promised". */

/* ── ONCE PER STUDENT PER TUTOR (D2, phase-a lane L3 · A6) ─────────────────

   isEffectivelyFreeFirst says whether a CLASS offers the free first session. A
   BOOKING is free only if, in addition, the student has not already had it with
   this tutor: no other free booking with them that is still live, and no free
   seat of theirs that they cancelled late themselves. POST /bookings evaluates
   that inside the seat-claim transaction, under a (student, tutor) advisory lock,
   so two simultaneous bookings cannot both take it.

   It COMES BACK when the tutor cancels (the student did not choose that), when
   the student cancels 48h or more before, when the platform releases the seat
   (block, consent withdrawal), and when a late cancel is waived because the
   tutor moved the class. It is SPENT only by the student's own late, un-waived
   cancellation of a free seat — the one case the 40% rule would apply to. The
   ledger row carries FREE_FIRST_SPENT_REASON so the booking path can see it:
   bookings.is_free is overwritten when a cancelled row is re-booked, the ledger
   is not. */
