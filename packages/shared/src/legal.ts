/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   EVERY LEGAL VALUE, IN ONE FILE.

   Retention periods, grace periods, the age of majority, document versions and
   the wording people agree to. Each carries a `LEGAL-REVIEW:` marker saying where
   the value came from and what counsel has to decide. NONE of them was set by a
   lawyer: they are the values the product already published (in /privacy, /terms,
   or the code) on or before 15 Sept 2026, gathered here so that counsel changes
   ONE line and every enforcement point and every sentence that quotes it follows.

   `grep -rn "LEGAL-REVIEW" packages apps` lists every open legal question.

   Pure values only: this module is imported by client components (/privacy,
   /terms render these numbers) and must never import a Node builtin.
