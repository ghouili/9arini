/* SERVER-ONLY INFRASTRUCTURE. Reached via the "@tnajem/shared/mail" (or /sms)
   SUBPATH and deliberately NOT re-exported from the barrel — the barrel is
   imported by client components, and dragging a mail transport into the
   browser bundle is the same mistake that broke the build when auth-core
   was barrelled (UnhandledSchemeError: node:crypto).

   There is no `import "server-only"` here for the same reason as @tnajem/db:
   Fastify and tsx both load this and server-only throws under tsx.

   It lives in shared rather than apps/api because BOTH apps need it during
   the Step 4 transition: the API sends OTP mail, and apps/web still runs
   lib/notify.ts. Once notify moves in the notif domain, this can follow it
   into apps/api. */

/* Email delivery for OTP codes — the sibling of lib/sms.ts, deliberately shaped the
   same way (mailEnabled / sendMail) so the two channels stay swappable behind
   otpChannel() in lib/auth.ts.

   WHY A DEPENDENCY HERE, WHEN lib/sms.ts HAS NONE. That file talks to Twilio over
   HTTPS, so `fetch` is the whole client and an SDK would be dead weight. SMTP is not
   HTTP: it is a stateful socket conversation (EHLO → AUTH → MAIL FROM → RCPT TO →
   DATA → QUIT) over implicit TLS, with base64 auth, RFC 2047 encoded-words for the
   Arabic subject line, CRLF discipline and dot-stuffing. `fetch` cannot speak it at
   all. nodemailer has ZERO transitive dependencies, so this adds one entry rather
   than a tree — and a subtle hand-rolled protocol bug here means nobody can log in.

   Configure with MAIL_HOST / MAIL_PORT / MAIL_SECURE / MAIL_USER / MAIL_PASS /
   MAIL_FROM_NAME / MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS / MAIL_REPLY_TO. When those are absent
   mailEnabled() is false and requestOtp() falls back to showing the code on-screen
   (dev mode only — it never does that once a provider is configured). */

/* ── TRUE SINGLETON, cached on globalThis ────────────────────────────────────
   Same pattern and the same reason as the Postgres client in lib/db/index.ts:
   Next's dev server re-evaluates this module on every save, and a bundler can
   instantiate a module twice in one process. A module-level createTransport()
   would therefore leak a whole pooled TLS connection set per edit, walking Gmail
   up to its concurrent-connection limit over an afternoon of work.

   pool:true also matters in production: without it every single login pays for a
   fresh TLS handshake with Gmail before the code can go out. */
