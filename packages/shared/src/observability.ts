/* What an error report is allowed to contain.
 *
 * ONE POLICY, TWO PROCESSES. The API and the web server each own their Sentry
 * client (they have different entry points and different failure shapes), but the
 * rule about what may leave the building must not exist twice — the second copy is
 * the one that quietly keeps an e-mail address.
 *
 * This module deliberately does NOT import @sentry/node. It is a pure options
 * factory: `sentryOptions()` returns a plain object each app hands to its own
 * Sentry.init, and `scrub()` is the function that empties the fields we refuse to
 * send. That keeps @tnajem/shared importable from a client component (it is, all
 * over apps/web) and keeps the node-only SDK out of every browser bundle.
 *
 * The sibling policy is apps/api/src/lib/logging.ts::REDACT_PATHS, which does the
 * same job for log lines. apps/api/test/sentry.test.ts asserts that every leaf key
 * listed there is also scrubbed here, so adding a PII field to one list and
 * forgetting the other fails a test instead of shipping.
 *
 * NOT SENT, EVER:
 *   - a session token or an OTP (hashed or not) — they are credentials
 *   - an e-mail address or a phone number — they are the login identity here
 *   - a document storage path — it locates a national ID scan
 *   - the query string of a URL — /doc?sig=… carries a signed capability
 *   - request bodies, cookies and headers wholesale (sendDefaultPii stays off)

/* ONE JSON LINE, for the failures that happen where there is no request logger.
 *
 * The API's pino logger covers everything inside a request. Mail, SMS and notify
 * live in @tnajem/shared and @tnajem/db, are called from both servers and from
 * cron, and have always written plain prose to console.error — which means the
 * signals Stage 7 has to alert on ("OTP send failures") were unparseable prose in
 * a pm2 log file. This makes them queryable without pulling a logger dependency
 * into packages that are imported by client components.
 *
 * The shape deliberately matches the one line that already existed in the app,
 * apps/web/lib/tutor-lookup.ts's `tutor_lookup_fail_open`:
 *     {"level":"error","event":"mail_send_failed","detail":"…","at":"<ISO>"}
 * so ONE log query — `event` present — finds all of them, and the alert rules in
 * OBSERVABILITY.md are written once. Note the fields differ from pino's (`level`
 * is a word, the timestamp is `at`): two shapes in one file is worse than two
 * shapes in two places, and e2e/tutor-lookup.spec.ts pins that one exactly,
 * including its key set — which is itself a privacy guard.
 *
 * Fields are scrubbed on the way out. Every caller already reduces its error to a
 * code, but the scrubber is what makes that a guarantee rather than a habit.
