/* ZERO CONTACT EXCHANGE — the allow-list.

   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ALLOW-LIST, NEVER A DENY-LIST. This is the whole design.
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   A deny-list ("strip phone and email before sending") fails the day someone adds
   a column. The new field ships to the counterparty by default and nobody
   notices, because nothing broke — that is how `studentPhone` and `studentEmail`
   ended up rendered as a `tel:` link and a `mailto:` link with the address as the
   visible label on the tutor dashboard.

   These functions BUILD a new object from named fields. A column added to
   `profiles` tomorrow is invisible here until someone deliberately adds it, and
   adding it means editing a file whose entire purpose is this rule.

   ── WHAT A COUNTERPARTY MAY SEE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
   A tutor looking at who booked, and a student looking at a tutor, get:

       a display name, and nothing else that could reach the person off-platform.

   Not the phone. Not the email. Not an address, not a city, not a social handle.
   Guardian contact is NOT an exception: a parent's number is a contact detail
   like any other, and Step 14 gives guardians real accounts rather than a bridge.

   ── WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   It does not stop a tutor reading a phone number aloud on Jitsi, and it is not
   meant to. The goal is to move contact exchange off the default path and make it
   a deliberate, visible act. detectContactInfo() in ./contact-info.ts handles the
   text channels; this file handles the structured fields.

   ── SELF IS NOT A COUNTERPARTY ───────────────────────────────────────────────
   None of this applies to a user's own data. GET /me and
   /profile/student/prefill return the caller's own phone and email, and must:
   you cannot edit a number you cannot see. The rule is about what one user sees
   of ANOTHER. */

    Tightened from publicName's "Amine K." — a surname initial plus a subject and
    a city narrows a person a long way in a country of twelve million, and it buys
    the reader nothing a first name does not.

    A single-word name is returned as-is; a name that is only whitespace or
    punctuation returns null rather than an empty string, so a caller cannot
    render an anonymous blank and think it is a name. */

/* ── The guard, for tests and for anything that serialises a counterparty ──────

   A cheap structural check that a payload carries no contact-shaped field. It is
   NOT the enforcement — publicProfile() is — but it is what lets a test assert
   "this whole response contains nothing that could reach the person", including
   fields added after the test was written.

   Names are matched, not values: a value scan would flag a class titled
   "Exercice 24" or a bio mentioning "Bac 2025". Detecting contact info inside
   free TEXT is a different problem with different false positives, and it lives
   in ./contact-info.ts. */
