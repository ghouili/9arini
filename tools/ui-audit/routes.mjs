/* ── SESSIONS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   The logged-in screens have to be audited AS the role they serve, and until now
   they were not audited at all.

   The old sentinel was `tnajem_session=demo`. It is not a session: getSession()
   matches it against the `sessions` table and finds nothing whenever a database is
   configured, and middleware.ts rejects the literal string outright in production.
   So every `auth: true` route was really being measured in its SIGNED-OUT state —
   which was survivable while those pages rendered an empty panel, and stopped being
   survivable when /onboarding, /onboarding/verify, /student/welcome and
   /onboarding/upgrade grew server-side role guards that REDIRECT. A harness that
   silently audits /auth six times while reporting six route names is worse than no
   harness.

   So: mint a real session row when a local database is available, one per role,
   and fall back to the sentinel when there is no DB (demo mode, where the page
   guards are inert by design and the screens render anyway).

   SAFETY RAIL: this writes rows, so it refuses any database that is not on
   localhost. An audit must never seed accounts into a real one. */
/* Email is the login identity (lib/auth.ts::otpChannel), so the audit accounts
   need one — a phone-only row would still session correctly, but it would not match
   what a real signup produces, and the account screen renders the address. The phone
   is kept alongside as the optional contact, so the tutor dashboard's contact column
   is exercised in its normal state. */

   render the "Accès réservé" panel on every admin screen — a shot of the refusal
   page, filed under the name of the queue, which is worse than no shot at all.

   So the harness signs in AS the first allowlisted address. That is picking an
   identity, not re-implementing the gate: requireAdmin() in apps/api is still the
   only thing that decides, and if this picks wrong the screenshot shows the denied
   panel and says so. Get-or-create, and the localhost-only rail above still
